                    I was born and raised in Israel. I was living their till the age of 15. Than me and my family moved
                    to
                    Bulgaria, where I graduated highschool. Now I moved to The Netherlands to study ICT at the HZ
                    University Of Applied Science.

                    I can say about myself that I am a very ambitious person who always strives for the highest. I set
                    goals for myself and
                    slowly reach them.

                    For me loyalt is the key to sucess. To be sorrounded by loyal people is the best, this is why I
                    am
                    always trying to be loyal to my sorroundings.
                    Last but not least discipline. For me it is mandatory. I work hard and overcome temptations so that
                    I will be able to
                    succeed in LIFE.

    <p>I am very curious about all the technology around us. Also I am a very logic person, so I find ICT to be the
        best subject for me to study. It has all the things I like and definitely a subject that has future.
