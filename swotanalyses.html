           <p>  My strengths
            I am a very communicative person. I can easily find a way to connect with people
          
           My weakness:
          
        is that I am overthinking too much stuff. But I am working on myself and I believe that in some time I will be able to overcome my overthinking
          
          Opportunities How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities? 
          
          Thanks to my communicative skills I have friends that help distract myself from overthinking too much.
          
          Threats What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career? 
          
          It can hold me back a bit but I am working on myself, and I can truly see a progress.
